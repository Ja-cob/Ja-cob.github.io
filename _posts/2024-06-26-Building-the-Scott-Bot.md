title: "Building The Scott-Bot"

Aka AI Mike

I've been wanting to do something fun that will help dust off my Data Science skills. I enjoy interacting with LLMs, but don't know much about building them. 

The plan is to take a data set of all the dialogue from The Office (US), isolate Michael Scott's conversations, and use that to train a Llama model. It's not technically building my own LLM, but it's close enough for now. 

I will update this post as I make progress.
