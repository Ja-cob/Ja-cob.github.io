# The Problem
Not too long ago, I had many projects broken down as blog posts. They were a reflection of who I used to be professionally. Now, I've changed and grown as a technology professional. I'm also a father now which presents it's own set of challenges and changes.

## Now What?
I want to showcase my personal projects and things that I'm actually excited about currently. The biggest challenge will be documenting what I do and making periodic updates.
