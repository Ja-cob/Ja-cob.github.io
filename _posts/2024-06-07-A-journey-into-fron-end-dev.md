title: "A Journey Into Front-end Dev"
---
I never had much interest in learning front-end languages. It all seemed very boring. 

However, I recently forced myself to learn HTML and CSS to build a site from scratch. It wasn't so bad once I figured out how things worked.
I have a new appreciation for frameworks, especially Astro. I ended up completely redoing my site in astro. It is a site for [my freelance services](https://Caprawave.com).
